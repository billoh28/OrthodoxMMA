### How to Throw a Jab

1. **Stand in boxing stance:**
*  Hands up, elbows in, hips between your feet, knees slightly bent, and back heel lifted. Front foot at slight angle generally pointing towards opponent, back foot about 45 degrees diagonal.

2. **Extend the glove:**
* Extend front glove towards your opponent.
* Move only the front arm. Don't shift weight forwards or backwards, keep weight at the centre.

3. **Rotate the arm:**
* While extending outwards, rotate the front arm so that the punch lands with the palm of the hand facing down and the shoulder covering the chin.
* When rotating the front shoulder, lift the shoulder give more reach and protect the chin.
* Tighten fist on impact.

### Common Mistakes with the Jab ###
* Don't allow the elbow to come in from the side. The elbow should come up from underneath the jab. Letting the elbow fly out reduces power and telegraphs to the opponent when the jab is coming.
* Dropping right hand.
* Reaching with the head.
* Not lifting front shoulder.
* Straightening legs while jabbing.
* Rotating the front foot.
